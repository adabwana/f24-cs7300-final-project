{"title":"Conclusion","markdown":{"headingText":"Conclusion","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n## Functional Programming in Statistical Computing\n\nThis project set out to challenge traditional **object-oriented** approaches to machine learning by implementing fundamental statistical algorithms in `Clojure`. The initial scope encompassed three core algorithms: **K-means clustering**, **Principal Component Analysis** (**PCA**), and **Linear Discriminant Analysis** (**LDA**). While we focused primarily on **PCA**, this concentrated effort revealed both the potential and limitations of *functional programming* in *statistical computing*.\n\n## Implementation Achievements\n\nThe **PCA** implementation demonstrates several key advantages of *functional programming*. Through careful attention to *immutability* and *pure functions*, we developed a numerically stable implementation that maintains mathematical rigor while providing explicit control over computational processes. The separation of concerns between *data transformation*, *eigendecomposition*, and visualization components illustrates how *functional programming* naturally supports modular algorithm design.\n\n## Technical Challenges\n\nSeveral technical challenges emerged during implementation. The *eigendecomposition* algorithm required careful consideration of *numerical stability* and performance optimization. While `Neanderthal` provides efficient *matrix operations*, bridging the gap between its imperative core and our functional interface demanded careful design decisions. The sign differences in *eigenvectors* between our implementation and `scikit-learn`'s highlighted the subtle complexities in *numerical computing* that persist regardless of programming paradigm.\n\n## Limitations and Future Work\n\nThe project's scope reduction from three algorithms to a focused **PCA** implementation reflects realistic constraints in academic software development. This limitation, however, allowed for deeper exploration of fundamental *numerical computing* challenges. Future work should address:\n\n1. Implementation of remaining algorithms (**K-means**, **LDA**)\n2. Performance optimization for large-scale datasets\n3. Enhanced parallelization of *matrix operations*\n4. Comprehensive benchmarking against established libraries\n\n## Broader Implications\n\nDespite its limited scope, this project demonstrates the viability of *functional programming* for *statistical computing*. `Clojure`'s *immutable data structures* and *pure functions* provide a robust foundation for implementing numerical algorithms. The combination of `Neanderthal`'s performance with *functional programming*'s modularity suggests a promising direction for developing statistical computing libraries.\n\nThe clear separation between *mathematical theory* and computational implementation, evident in our documentation and code structure, indicates that *functional programming* may offer advantages in teaching and understanding statistical algorithms. However, the project also reveals that successful statistical computing libraries must balance theoretical purity with practical performance considerations.\n\n## Final Assessment\n\nWhile this implementation falls short of the original proposal's ambitious scope, it provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of *functional programming* in *statistical computing*. The successful **PCA** implementation, validated against industry-standard tools, suggests that `Clojure` and `Neanderthal` could form the basis of a robust statistical computing ecosystem. Future development should focus on expanding the algorithm collection while maintaining the careful balance between *functional purity* and computational efficiency demonstrated in this initial work.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"conclusion.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
