# Conclusion

## Functional Programming in Statistical Computing

This project set out to challenge traditional **object-oriented** approaches to machine learning by implementing fundamental statistical algorithms in `Clojure`. The initial scope encompassed three core algorithms: **K-means clustering**, **Principal Component Analysis** (**PCA**), and **Linear Discriminant Analysis** (**LDA**). While we focused primarily on **PCA**, this concentrated effort revealed both the potential and limitations of *functional programming* in *statistical computing*.

## Implementation Achievements

The **PCA** implementation demonstrates several key advantages of *functional programming*. Through careful attention to *immutability* and *pure functions*, we developed a numerically stable implementation that maintains mathematical rigor while providing explicit control over computational processes. The separation of concerns between *data transformation*, *eigendecomposition*, and visualization components illustrates how *functional programming* naturally supports modular algorithm design.

## Technical Challenges

Several technical challenges emerged during implementation. The *eigendecomposition* algorithm required careful consideration of *numerical stability* and performance optimization. While `Neanderthal` provides efficient *matrix operations*, bridging the gap between its imperative core and our functional interface demanded careful design decisions. The sign differences in *eigenvectors* between our implementation and `scikit-learn`'s highlighted the subtle complexities in *numerical computing* that persist regardless of programming paradigm.

## Limitations and Future Work

The project's scope reduction from three algorithms to a focused **PCA** implementation reflects realistic constraints in academic software development. This limitation, however, allowed for deeper exploration of fundamental *numerical computing* challenges. Future work should address:

1. Implementation of remaining algorithms (**K-means**, **LDA**)
2. Performance optimization for large-scale datasets
3. Enhanced parallelization of *matrix operations*
4. Comprehensive benchmarking against established libraries

## Broader Implications

Despite its limited scope, this project demonstrates the viability of *functional programming* for *statistical computing*. `Clojure`'s *immutable data structures* and *pure functions* provide a robust foundation for implementing numerical algorithms. The combination of `Neanderthal`'s performance with *functional programming*'s modularity suggests a promising direction for developing statistical computing libraries.

The clear separation between *mathematical theory* and computational implementation, evident in our documentation and code structure, indicates that *functional programming* may offer advantages in teaching and understanding statistical algorithms. However, the project also reveals that successful statistical computing libraries must balance theoretical purity with practical performance considerations.

## Final Assessment

While this implementation falls short of the original proposal's ambitious scope, it provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of *functional programming* in *statistical computing*. The successful **PCA** implementation, validated against industry-standard tools, suggests that `Clojure` and `Neanderthal` could form the basis of a robust statistical computing ecosystem. Future development should focus on expanding the algorithm collection while maintaining the careful balance between *functional purity* and computational efficiency demonstrated in this initial work.
